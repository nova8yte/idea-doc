### **How it looks? **

Imagine your imagination spread out into existence, alongside everyone else’s! Think of it as a reflection of your creative mind transformed into a navigable space where you can manifest, move, and be anything. It’s both static and fluid - shaped by the limits of your mind and, practically, by our ever-expanding computational and software resources. Start from a limited perspective and unlock more as your imagination grows.

Ultimately, the Metaverse is subjective. At its core, it distills experiences into basic, universally understood concepts, the building blocks of movement and identity, almost like child’s play.

It’s about fixing the things you hate in life or sharing your struggles - a shared space where memes, experiences, and desires converge.

I’d love to have an infinite teleport that lets me explore every corner of the Metaverse, or a room with infinite doorways into its countless realms, like small windows into infinite possibilities, each leading to an entirely new reality. PORTAL ROOM!

What about you? What you've been always dreaming about, or hate experiencing.
