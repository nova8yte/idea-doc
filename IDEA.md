# **The problem of the __Fully depicting Metaverse__** 
Sharing the Metaverse is like consciousness, everyone has a different version of YOU in their mind, and you can’t fully prove it.

You can’t fully transmit what’s in your head without some compression. Unfortunately, words are linear, and sharing spatial concepts has always been accomplished through architecture because, in essence, we’re all architects of the Metaverse. Here, with the help of context, I’ll try to bridge some of those gaps.

## **Problem with Metaverse.**
Everyone visualizes it based on their own ability to imagine concepts and ideas. No two people picture the same Metaverse; it’s like different worlds with many similarities. When building software, you don’t get caught up in the differences, you start by establishing a structure from experience and then narrow it down to what’s essential for an MVP (minimum viable product) that attracts investors.

### **Practically speaking,**
Exploring the finer details requires significant time and funding.
Everyone dreams of infinite possibilities, but turning those dreams into a working Metaverse requires structured design, clear goals, and a balance between creativity and computation.

What time has taught me is that no one wants to invest in architecture that solves nothing, whereas the Universe is always solving its own problems. That, to me, is mastery.

Perhaps the goal of the Metaverse is to help people solve whatever they desire within it.

Just look at minecraft.

## **How do we make sense of the Metaverse? Let’s start with logic.**
To truly depict something without losing details, it’s best to approach it from the three principles of logic:

1. **Law of identity** - A thing that's given identity is identical to itself.
> So if I state a Cup ":coffee:" - is an open-top vessel (container) used to hold liquids for drinking. 
> The color, what it holds, difference in texture are Properties, which shall be included with specific type of a cup. A cup of coffee per example. Which adds specifics to help in determining a thing or a concept that the person refers to.
2. **Law of non-contradiction **
> This principle means that if something is a cat, it cannot simultaneously be not a cat. It preserves meaning consistently across time and space.
3. **And law of the excluded middle**
> There are no in-between answers. The cat is either cat or not. If it's a cat with a half being dog, then it's another type of a being. 
> Like :white_heart: if you loved watching CatDog TV Series!

## **So, what is Metaverse?.** 
The word “Metaverse” comes from “Meta” and “Universe.”
- So Meta is a prefix that means more comprehensive or transcending, simply put beyond. 
I'm taking this from spirituality, as it explains beautifully.
> The idea of going beyond the limits of ordinary experience or understanding, reaching a state of being that is beyond the physical realm. 
> It allows people to do what they can’t in reality, like experiencing out-of-body movement or flying.
- Universe refers to all of space, time, and their contents.
> Which are simply put 4D Space-Time as described in Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity! :headstone:  R.I.P.

2. Line. :white_circle::white_circle::white_circle: 
> A seamless series of dots where one flows into the next represents 2D space.
3. Plain.

> A line made of planes—this is what we call space-time, or 4D.

## **Conclusion of basics.**

By breaking down these fundamental elements, we can say that the
